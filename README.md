# A Refresher for NER
**musical-mirket**
-----

NER project to define the entities of sentences. Inspired on the tutorials by Aman Kharwal, and improved by adding the following tasks:

- Use of Bidirectional LSTM with Attention Mechanism: This can help the model focus on different parts of the input sequence more effectively.
- Dropout Layers: To prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
- Pre-trained Embeddings: Such as GloVe or FastText embeddings can provide better initial representations of words compared to simple word embeddings.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the model's parameters (like learning rate, batch size) for optimal performance.
- Early Stopping: To avoid overfitting and save the best model.

Such improvement was aimed for the NER system to be more efficent, and capable of better understanding and extracting information from text data.
